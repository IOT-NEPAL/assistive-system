## How to Use

### For Users
1. **First Visit**: A modal will appear asking you to select your accessibility needs
2. **Accessibility Controls**: Use the controls in the top-right corner to adjust settings
3. **Colorblind Simulation**: Click the colorblind buttons (N, P, D, T, M) to simulate different types
4. **Reset Settings**: Use the reset button (ðŸ”„) to return to default settings
